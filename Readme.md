# Car-Wish-List
*** 
***
I created this app so you can store your favorite cars with ease.
All you need is the name of the car and the URL of a picture of the car.
Then give it a rating and hit _Add Whip!_
You can update the rating of the car later on as well.
Or if desired delete the car as a whole.

## Steps to make the app work
***
1. Install files onto your local machine
2. Navigate to the project in your terminal
3. Be at the root of the project
4. Type _npm i_ into terminal to install dependencies
5. Then type _nodemon_ in the terminal to get the server running

## Unique parts of the project
***
Added _top_ button on bottom right corner.
This allows you to automatically scroll to the top of the page.
RGB lighting on _Add Whip!_ button.
Also an animated background to give the project extra detail.
